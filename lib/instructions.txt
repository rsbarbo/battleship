Battleship
==========

The game
--------

Long version: [see wikipedia](https://secure.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/wiki/Battleship_game)

* Each player starts with a fleet of 5 ships, of length 5, 4, 3, 3, and 2.
* Each player places their ships horizontally or vertically on a 10x10 grid; this is not visible to their opponent.
* Players take turns to fire at positions on the grid, gradually revealing where their opponent’s ships are and are not located.
* A ship is destroyed when every cell of a ship has been hit.
* The winner is the first player to destroy their opponent’s fleet.

You lose if:

* You do not place the correct number and size of ships.
* You place your fleet in impossible positions (ships overlapping or partly off the board).
* Your code raises an exception.
* All your ships have been sunk.

### Additional rules

* The official interpreter is Ruby 2.1.0.
* The player will not have access to the game objects.
* The player may `require` Ruby source files from within a `lib` directory in the same place as the player file (i.e. `contestants/player.rb` can use `contestants/lib/foo/bar.rb` via `require "foo/bar"`.)
* A file should not implement more than one player class.
* The judge’s decision is final.
